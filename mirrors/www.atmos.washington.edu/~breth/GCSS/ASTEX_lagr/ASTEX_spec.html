Run Description and Setup for ASTEX Lagrangian GCSS Intercomparison

This intercomparison is based on the <A href="http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~breth/astex/lagr/README.hourly.html">hourly ASTEX Lagrangian dataset</A>.  
Follow this link to read about this
dataset and link to the data directory.  All filenames herein are
relative to that directory.

(a)  Full Lagrangian simulations

We propose two simulations appropriate for 1D and 2D models that
can be used in a 'Lagrangian' mode in which the properties of
air above the boundary layer are relaxed to specified
time-varying profiles:

(1) Lagrangian 1 (42 hours, starting on June 12.67)
(2) Lagrangian 2 (40 hours, starting on June 18.93).

The initial conditions for simulation 1 are in the files
lagr1/hourly/lagr1_00.  The changing boundary conditions at hour hh
(together with the observed boundary layer sounding) are in file
lagr1_hh.  See file README.hourly for a complete description of the
hourly data, as well as a description of currently available
verification datasets.

(b)  Short simulations

We also propose two shorter simulations feasible for 3D LES models
(and also interesting comparisons for 2D and 1D models).  These are
based on shorter intervals within the Lagrangian experiments.  The
simulated periods have been chosen so that upper air thermodynamic
properties change negligibly during the integration, making a
'Lagrangian' simulation simpler to carry out:

(3) A three hour long simulation starting at hour 12 of Lagrangian 1 
    (June 13.167) suitable for both 2D and 3D models.  At this time,
    stratocumulus with sustained drizzle rates of more than 1 mm/day
    at the ground was observed as the SST under the air column
    increased very rapidly.  This simulation is largely (but not 
    entirely) nocturnal.  The initial conditions for simulation (3)
    can be found in file lagr1/hourly/lagr1_12 and the variation of
    SST, lat, lon can be taken from file lagr1/lagr1/hourly/scalars.

(4) A six hour long simulation suitable for both 2D and 3D
    models of a deep 'decoupled' boundary layer with cumulus
    clouds rising into patchy stratocumulus, starting at hour 32
    of Lagrangian 2 (June 20.25) .  The goal here is 
    to compare the predictions of cloud fraction and optical
    properties by different models.  The initial conditions for simulation (4)
    can be found in file lagr2/hourly/lagr_32 and the variation of
    SST, lat, lon can be taken from file lagr2/hourly/scalars.

Simulations 3 and 4 have been chosen so that the time variations of
the above-inversion conditions appear to be small over the length of
the simulation.  For simplicity, we will run them with all external
boundary conditions fixed at their initial values in the hourly
sounding archive except SST and the diurnal cycle.  SST and solar
zenith angle should be computed for these simulations as discussed in
the Boundary Conditions section below.  Both cases 3 and 4 include
daytime periods, though for case 3, solar radiation may be
comparatively unimportant.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Initial & boundary conditions, modelling assumptions and other useful
information


(a) Time interpolation

For all simulations, we recommend that between hours, linear
interpolation in time be used to get continuously varying boundary
data.


(b) Domain translation velocity

Those of you with LES type models will probably choose to use a
reference frame that moves along approximately with the mean flow to
minimize numerical stability constraints on the model timestep.  We
see two choices for handling domain translation:

1. Choose a constant domain translation speed (in x, y directions). The
frame does not accelerate relative to the earth's surface.

2. Choose a time-varying domain translation speed (in x, y directions)
(so as to follow changes in the mean boundary layer wind with time in
a Lagrangian simulation).  The frame now accelerates relative to the
surface of the earth, and the acceleration of the frame should be
accounted for in the model momentum equations.


(c) Initial conditions in saturated air

As mentioned in README.hourly, the water vapor mixing ratio in the
hourly sounding may not be saturated even though mean liquid water is
present, due both to horizontal inhomogeneity and measurement errors.
Thus, to ensure thermodynamic consistency with the measured mean
liquid water in your initial conditions, you should replace the water
vapor mixing ratio by the saturation water vapor mixing ratio at any
heights in the sounding at which either (i) the droplet concentration
is at least 0.5 as large as the estimated in-cloud droplet
concentration or (ii) the liquid water mixing ratio ql is at least
0.05 g/kg.


(d) Baroclinicity

If the geostrophic wind varies with height, thermal wind balance
implies that there must be horizontal temperature gradients, and it is
inconsistent to assume that the temperature and pressure fields are
periodic in the horizontal.  However, if your model cannot handle
this, you should ignore the mean horizontal temperature gradients, and
treat temperature and pressure fields are periodic in the horizontal.
This assumption, most accurate for a small model domain such as we
are using, is akin to including mean subsidence without explicitly
including the divergent component of the horizontal mean wind.  Note
how baroclinicity is handled in the Model Description section of your
output in the Physical Parameterizations section.


(e) Downwelling longwave radiation

Boundary layer cloud simulations are well known to be quite sensitive
to the downwelling flux of longwave radiation at the boundary layer
top.  To ensure we are all in the same ballpark, note that the hourly
sounding files all contain a measured value of downwelling LW flux at
700 mb (Austin and Bretherton 1995).  With the exception of June
19.4-19.75 during Lagrangian 2, during which there was cirrus cloud
cover, these downwelling fluxes agree very well with clear air
calculations based on temperature and moisture profiles taken from
ECMWF analyses done for ASTEX (Austin and Bretherton 1995).  The
hourly soundings include coarse resolution ECMWF-analyzed profiles
above 700 mb suitable for radiative transfer calculations.  

If your code uses a full atmospheric column radiation subroutine, use
it but check that your downwelling longwave flux at 700 mb is close
(within 10 W/m2) of the hourly specified value.  If it isn't you might
want to adjust your mixing ratio at pressures below 700 mb to match
the desired downwelling longwave flux at 700 mb.  If your code
specifies the radiative fluxes at the top of the model domain, use the
hourly value given, correcting it to the height of your domain top as
described in README.hourly in the discussion of LW_dn in the header of
the hourly file.


(f) Relaxation in free atmosphere for Lagrangian runs

For simulations (1) and (2) in which free atmospheric conditions are
to be varied in a specified fashion with time, use the following
relaxation, which has a time constant long enough to not suppress the
transmission of gravity waves and which is only applied significantly above the
maximum inversion height:

zimax = max over all columns of local zi
local zi = height at which gradient of total water mixing ratio is maximum.

For any scalar field F, add a term onto dF/dt at heights z >= zimax + 75 m:

(dF/dt)_relax = - (F - Fe(z,t))/tau

where F is the actual value of the scalar, Fe(z,t) is its target value, and
tau = 3 hrs.

No relaxation is used on the velocities, because the time varying
geostrophic wind maintains a reasonable wind profile.


(g) Upper boundary condition for gravity waves

In the effort to be as realistic as possible, you may want to use
either a sponge layer for damping perturbation momentum or a radiation
upper boundary condition to minimize spurious reflection of upward
propagating gravity waves.  The sponge layer should not start any
lower than 200 m above the mean inversion height.


(h) For use with your radiation scheme:

Solar constant:  1323 W/m2  (due to the variation of the earth-sun distance
d from its mean value dm, the solar ``constant'' is reduced from its mean
value. For June 16, the ratio (dm/d)**2 = 0.9690, so S = smean * (dm/d)**2
= 1323 W / m^2.)


If you need formulas for the variation of zenith angle with time, lat, lon:

cosine(zenith angle) = 
     max( -cos(sun_lat)*cos(sun_azim)*cos_lat + sin(sun_lat)*sin_lat, 0.)   
  where
     lat = latitude (degrees N),   sin_lat = sin(pi*lat/180.)
                                   cos_lat = cos(pi*lat/180.)
     lon = longitude (degrees E, <0 for degrees W)
     day = decimal day of June (UTC).
     month = 6 + day/30.
     pi   = 3.1415926...
     sun_azim = 2*pi*(day - lon/360.) (radians)
     sun_lat = (pi*23./180.)*cos((month - 6.75)*pi/6) (radians)

(h) Changing surface pressure

  Over the course of each Lagrangian, surface pressure changes
slightly (by 2-4 mb over 40 hours).  If you use reference profiles in
your dynamical equations and to compute thermodynamic coefficients, it
should suffice to choose reference values based on the initial
sounding.  However, be aware of the surface pressure variations in
calculations (such as finding saturation mixing ratio and temperature
knowing potential temperature and height) which depend upon the
horizontal mean pressure at a given height at a given time.


(i)  Use your model's regular scheme for calculating surface heat,
moisture and momentum fluxes, and for determining eddy diffusivity,
TKE, etc. at the lowest gridpoint above the sea-surface. Contact one
of us if you would like to know what we use. However, the purpose of
this intercomparison is to compare the effect of different approaches
to physical parameterization as well as different numerics.


(j)        Other Details

* Set sea-surface albedo = 0.05

* Periodic lateral BC's

* Mean subsidence specified from given horizontal divergence on hourly
file header

* Coriolis forcing based on given latitude (use fixed latitude of 
35 degrees N if it is inconvenient to make f time-varying)

* Holton's values for physical constants:
    g=9.81 m/s^2, R=287 J/(K-kg), Cp=1004 J/(K-kg), L=2.5e6 J/kg.
  If it is convenient for you to use these values, please do so.

* Random Initialization : spatially uncorrelated random perturbation
uniformly distributed between -0.1 and 0.1 K, applied to initial
temperature field at all gridpoints below the initial inversion height.

            Data Format for Presenting Results


Our intercomparison results will be presented in seven different sets,
some split into two parts to avoid making lines of more than 80
characters that may be mangled by electronic mailers.  The data format
chosen here has been optimized for Steve Krueger's plotting programs.
Sets F and G are optional, and investigate in more detail the TKE
budget and use of conditional sampling.  If you have a 1D model or if
you don't wish to do parts F and G, just enter just the first five
sets.

The data format for presenting intercomparisons is modelled on
Chin-Hoh's format for the first intercomparison, but because of the
nature of the run, there are some differences, so read carefully.  We
have made an effort to only refer to quantitities (i. e., total liquid
water, rather than cloud water separately) that also make sense for
models with explicit microphysics. In what follows, f-bar refers to a
horizontal average of f.  The layer average of f is the vertical
average of f-bar from the surface to the boundary layer top (inversion)
height zi (which is defined in C1.2 below).  Please precede each
dataset below by a line of up to 80 characters including a comment
identifier #k, the run number (1,2,3, or 4), letter identifying the
dataset, (for sets D-G) the middle of the averaging hour, the
investigator first initial_last name and, optionally, any further
distinguishing characteristics, separated by spaces, e. g.

Since models change, we are asking all participants to again fill out
a model description section as was done last time.  Since the purpose
of an intercomparison is to understand how and why different models
yield different results when applied to the same problem, please
complete applicable parts of this section carefully.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Sets A1 and A2 document the initial conditions and attempt a crude radiative
      intercomparison between models.

(13)Initial reference density profile rho(z) (kg/m^3)
    (use mean density for compressible models)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sets B and C1/C2 compare the time evolution of various scalars through 
the whole simulation period.
  
For set B, use instantaneous values with a sampling time interval of
between 1 and 5 minutes for cases 3 and 4, and between 5 and 10
minutes for cases 1 and 2.  

(1) Simulation time (in min)
(2) SST (K)
(3) Cloud fraction (0-1), defined as the fraction of columns with at
     least one gridpoint in which liquid water mixing ratio exceeds 0.01 g/kg.
(4) 'Satellite-detectable' cloud fraction (0-1), defined as the fraction of
     grid columns in which the column-integrated liquid water path exceeds 
     13 g/m^2 (this corresponds to a cloud optical depth of 2, roughly
     the minimum thickness of cloud detectable from its increased albedo
     compared to the sea-surface.)
(5) Mean column-integrated liquid water path (in g/m^2).  The mean is 
    taken only over cloudy columns as defined in B.3.  If there are no such
    columns, enter 0.
(6) Mean of the cloud base height (defined as the lowest height at which the
    cloud fraction defined by D.7 exceeds 0.01) (in m).  The mean is

For sets C1/C2, use hourly average values.  For the 'simulation time'
enter the midpoint of the hour.  While some of this information
duplicates entries in Set D, this data format is more convenient for
our plotting script.  Other scalars duplicate set B.  For these
scalars, the hourly average in C is useful for comparing with other
hourly average profiles and B helps pin down the variability of that
scalar.

    cloudy) (0-1).

    (use mean density for compressible models)

 The data format for Set D is (3F8.2, 5F8.3).

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Set E1/E2 compares the hourly averaged turbulent velocity variances, skewness,
and flux profiles (resolved plus subgrid, except where explicitly mentioned):

Set E1
(1) height (in meters), where the following fluxes in E1/E2 locate, 
(2) u'^2 + v'^2-bar  (in m^2/s^2)
(3) w'^2-bar  (in m^2/s^2)

 The data format for Set F is (F8.2, F9.2, 6F10.5).  
 The formulas above are correct for a Boussinesq fluid, but should be
 modified as needed to correspond to the equation set you are using.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set G1/G2 compares the hourly average vertical profiles of conditionally
sampled fields. The purposes of this dataset are (a) to follow the
evolution of the boundary layer circulation, and (b) to
provide these results in a form that can be compared with aircraft
measurements. Each grid point will be classified as either an updraft
point (w > 0.5 m/s), a downdraft point (w  -0.5 m/s), or an environment
point (-0.5 .le. w .le. 0.5 m/s).  Note that w is the vertical velocity
relative to the specified large-scale subsidence, so that w-bar = 0.
