<p><u>Deadline for submission of revised results</u>:&nbsp; <b>1 August 2005</b></p>
<p>Preliminary results were <a href="GCSS1-200505-Athens/RF02-SCM.ppt">presented by Chris
Bretherton</a> and discussed at BLCWG breakout of pan-GCSS meeting.</a>, Athens Greece, 
16-20 May 2005. This discussion led to several small modifications to the LES
case that we are also adopting, including changed droplet conc.,
changed geostrophic winds, and specified surface heat and moisture fluxes. </p>

<h4>Discussion and Motivation</h4>
<p>This single column model (SCM) intercomparison is a companion to the GCSS 
DYCOMS RF02 LES intercomparison, organized by Andy Ackerman of NASA-Ames.&nbsp; 
The goal is to compare SCM simulations of a <b>nocturnal drizzling 
stratocumulus-topped boundary layer</b> with each other, with LES simulations, 
and with comprehensive observations taken during DYCOMS-II.&nbsp; The
<a href="http://sky.arc.nasa.gov:6996/ack/gcss9/index.html">RF02 LES 
intercomparison web page</a> describes the case, corresponding observations and 
papers discussing them,&nbsp; and some minor idealizations made to facilitate 
model intercomparison. </p>
<p>This case follows on our GCSS BLCWG intercomparison of a nocturnal 
non-precipitating stratocumulus-topped mixed layer observed in DYCOMS RF01.&nbsp; 
The intercomparison (<a href="ftp://eos.atmos.washington.edu/pub/breth/papers/in-review/GCSS1-DYCOMS-LES.html">Stevens 
et al. 2005</a> for LES,
<a href="ftp://eos.atmos.washington.edu/pub/breth/papers/in-review/GCSS1-DYCOMS-SCM.html">
Zhu et al. 2005</a> for SCM, both accepted by <i>Mon. Wea. Rev.</i>) showed that 
even in this particularly simple boundary layer, cloud liquid water path (LWP) 
varied by almost an order of magnitude between both SCM and LES models.&nbsp; A 
few LES models (with subgrid turbulence and advection schemes that tended to 
suppress mixing across the strong inversion overlaying the stratocumulus)&nbsp; 
did obtain approximately correct LWP for this case. However, a challenge in the 
drizzling case both for LES and SCM models is sorting out the effects of 
turbulent mixing and of drizzle in determining the boundary layer structure and 
LWP.&nbsp; Another challenge for SCM models is that aerosol and cloud droplet 
concentrations were lower in RF02 than RF01, favoring drizzle production. This 
feedback is not represented in many SCMs.&nbsp; However, given the potential 
importance of precipitation processes to both the mean albedo of stratocumulus 
in some regions, and the second aerosol indirect ('Albrecht') effect on climate, 
this is an important issue to tackle in an intercomparison format.</p>
<p><b>SCM Specifications</b></p>
<p><u>Setup</u></p>
<ul>
  <li>Initial sounding, surface fluxes, and geostrophic wind as in LES 
  specifications. Upon request, I will provide an alternative wind profile based 
  on LES simulations if you want to specify the wind profile rather than 
  determine it from the geostrophic forcing.</li>
  <li>Mean horizontal divergence and radiation as specified in LES 
  specifications, which are the same as in RF01 case.</li>
  <li>Cloud droplet concentration of 55 cm<sup>-3</sup>, if this is an input 
  parameter your SCM can use.&nbsp; Otherwise, use your SCM's default 
  microphysical assumptions over the ocean. Please let us know which
  of these options you are using!</li>
  <li>Six hour simulations</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Sensitivity studies</u> - do whichever you can.</p>
<ul>
  <li>As with the previous SCM intercomparison, we request results with both 
  (HR) 10 m vertical and 5 s temporal grid spacing and (LR) a standard vertical 
  and temporal resolution at which the SCM or associated GCM is run.</li>
  <li>At each resolution, compare whichever of the following your
  model can be configured to do: (PS) default precipitation microphysics, including
  sedimentation, (P) default precipitation microphysics, no
  sedimentation, (S) no precipitation but sedimentation included, (N)
  no precipitation or sedimentation.</li>
  <li>Using your model's default vertical/time resolution and
  microphysics (but drop conc.=55 if possible) try (C) default cumulus convection scheme and (NC) no cumulus convection 
  (shallow or deep).</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Output</u> (netcdf format)</p>
<ul>
  <li>NetCDF, use self-describing file name such as HR.P.C.wyant-scalars.nc for 
  scalars from Wyant's hi-res SCM run with default precipitation microphysics 
  and cumulus convection. Use suffix -profiles.nc for hourly profiles. Variables 
  in the following sets are as described in
  <a href="http://sky.arc.nasa.gov:6996/ack/gcss9/output.html">Andy's output 
  specs</a> (please check you have the right dimensions for all variables!)</li>
  <li>Scalar time series (every timestep) of variables: {time}, {zi}, {zb}, {lwp}, 
  {cfrac}, {shf}, {vhf}, {precip}, {ustar}. For {cfrac} use the maximum cloud 
  fraction obtained at any model level at that time.</li>
  <li>Half-hourly-average profiles: Dimensions and independent variables as in 
  Andy's specs: {rho}, {u}, {v}, {thetal}, {qt}, {ql}, {cfrac, {rad_flx}, {precip}, 
  {tot_tw}, {tot_qw}, {tot_uw}, {tot_vw}, {tot_boy}, {tot_shr}&nbsp; If your 
  model does not compute all the fluxes, just do not define those profiles. 
  Initial flux profiles can be left undefined. </li>
</ul>
