<br><b>Abstract</b>
<p>Cloud resolving model simulations of organised tropical convection in
TOGA-COARE are used
<br>to evaluate versions of the ECMWF convection scheme and cloud schemes
in single column model
<br>simulations. Emphasis is placed upon the ability of the convection
scheme to represent "cloud scale"
<br>processes, with a typically mode 1 heating structure through the troposphere,
with the cloud scheme
<br>representing the stratiform (mesoscale) component with upper level
heating and low level cooling due to
<br>the evaporation of precipitation. While diagnosis of convective and
stratiform precipitation is sensitive
<br>to the sampling criteria applied to the CRM, vertical structures of
the mass and heat budgets are robust.
<br>Using diagnostics from the cloud resolving model simulations as a guide,
revisions to the convection and
<br>cloud schemes are suggested in order to enable the parametrization
to represent the two scales. The
<br>study suggests that a mass flux convection scheme linked via detrainment
to a prognostic treatment of
<br>cloud can represent organised convection provided the upward motion
in the upper level stratiform cloud
<br>is considered.
