<br>Subject: Report on the meeting in Lisbon
<p>Dear WG4 Members,
<p>I attended the joint EUROCS/GCSS workshop last week in Lisbon. EUROCS
<br>is a European Union project similar in scope to GCSS (see their web
<br>page at http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gcss/EUROCS/EUROCS.html if you need
<br>more information). The WG1 of GCSS (boundary layer clouds) had their
<br>meeting there as well; WG1 and boundary layer working group of EUROCOS
<br>work very closely. Below I include a report from the discussions at
the
<br>workshop. It is relevant to future activities within WG4, so please
<br>keep reading and give me you feedback.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>1. THE NEXT WG4 CASE.
<p>We agreed in Silver Springs meeting last fall that the next test case
<br>will be associated with the diurnal cycle of deep convection over
<br>land.&nbsp; In Lisbon, Christian Jakob from ECMWF presented an appealing
<br>case for the convection over the Amazon basin. An existence of the
data
<br>from the TRMM/LBA campaign in this region and an experience some WG4
<br>members have with this case (NASA Goddard group for example) would
be
<br>very useful. I hope we can discuss this case before the October WG4
<br>meeting in Boulder and use it as the next deep convection case. The
<br>fact that large-scale models allow deep convection to develop much
too
<br>early during the day over the Amazon basin (one of the major points
in
<br>Christian's presentation) make this case highly relevant to the
<br>convection parameterization issue within SCMs. Moreover, LBA
<br>observations provide information not only on the boundary layer
<br>development early during the day, but also on the modifications
<br>associated with precipitation and downdrafts in late afternoon hours
<br>(one of conclusions of SCMs running the ARM case was that the downdraft
<br>mass flux was much smaller than predicted by CRMs; these certainly
<br>affects the boundary layer characteristics). Running CRMs for this
<br>case will be important for the improvements of the SCMs, which is one
<br>of the goals of the GCSS. Setting up this case requires some
<br>decision-making upfront, however, and your input is needed.
<p>The deep convection over the LBA area falls into two categories (Tao,
<br>please correct if I miss anything): i) monsoon type with surface
<br>westerly flow and popcorn-type deep convection, and ii) break type
with
<br>surface easterly flow and organized squall line type convection.&nbsp;
The
<br>first type should be our primary interest as in this case convection
<br>develops gradually over the domain during the day and the influence
of
<br>organized systems propagating from outside the area (as typically
<br>happens in the break type convection) is likely not an issue. According
<br>to W.K. Tao, there is only a single day (February 23) if we insist
on
<br>having aircraft microphysical measurements, TRMM satellite overpasses,
<br>and radar data to compare model results with the observations. However,
<br>there are other cases I think where the radar data are available (e.g.,
<br>Rutledge et al. paper 5B.5 from the 24th AMS Conference on Hurricanes
<br>and Tropical Meteorology, 2000, Ft. Lauderdale, shows some radar data
<br>from February 25th case). I feel that we should select a day where
<br>there is a continues radar coverage from the morning hours (when
<br>convection begins) till the deep convection phase in the afternoon,
if
<br>at all possible. Satellite data should be also useful with this
<br>respect. These data should allow us to verify the model-predicted mean
<br>rate at which convection deepens over a large area as the diurnal cycle
<br>progresses.
<p>Unfortunately, there are some issues as far as the forcing of the model
<br>is concerned. LBA had a sounding network, but I am not sure if the
<br>budgets have been derived from the data yet (we need Q1 and Q2 to drive
<br>our models) and if we can trust these products. Another possibility
is
<br>to use large-scale advective tendencies from the ECMWF model, but since
this
<br>model features too rapid convective development in the late morning,
<br>the large-scale vertical velocity may have nothing to do with the real
<br>world. We may decide just to neglect the large-scale forcing
<br>altogether and rely on the surface and radiative forcings only.
<br>However, according to W.K. Tao, surface fluxes derived from LBA
<br>observations seem too high. This statement is based on some simulations
<br>they did using the February 23rd case. I think some experience from
the
<br>EUROCOS case (see below) might help us. I can run a few test cases
<br>before we agree on the final TRMM-LBA setup.
<p>An important aspect of this case is that we may benefit from
<br>collaboration with the WG1 (boundary layer clouds) which recently
<br>considered a scattered shallow convection case and growing boundary
<br>layer (a report on that was presented in Lisbon). The agreement between
<br>CRMs (LES models in fact) was impressive and it was emphasized that
SCMs
<br>(a few that participated) require a lot of work to match CRMs in the
<br>scattered shallow convection case.
<p>However, before we agree on the details of the LBA-based case, we can
<br>benefit from the EUROCOS deep convection case.&nbsp; EUROCOS deep convection
<br>participants agreed to look into an idealized case of diurnal cycle
of
<br>convection over land based on the first day of ARM subcase A. As you
<br>may remember from WG4 previous meetings (and CRMs/SCMs papers now
<br>submitted to QJ), the subcase A features two small events in the first
<br>part of the period, and a major event towards the end. The first of
the
<br>two weaker events is dominated by diurnal effects, with a weak
<br>large-scale forcing. You may also remember that original 2-km
<br>horizontal resolution CRM simulations of this subcase featured a delay
<br>in precipitation development. This delay was removed once a higher
<br>horizontal resolution was used (both Jon Petch and Marat Khairoutdinov
<br>presented some supporting results in Silver Springs).
<p>Francoise Guichard and Jon Petch (leaders of the EUROCOS deep
<br>convection group) agreed to prepare details of this case by the end
of
<br>June. The proposal is to use a smaller domain in 2D (say, 250 km),
a
<br>horizontal resolution of 250 m, and run the case for, say, 3 days,
<br>using the perpetual large-scale forcing and surface fluxes. I think
I
<br>will be able to run this case before the October meeting. I will keep
<br>all of you posted and hope that at least some of you will find time
to
<br>run this case and present results in Boulder. Participation of SCMs
in
<br>this case is important and the experience gained will benefit the
<br>design of the LBA-based case.
<p>2. UPCOMING MEETINGS.
<p>WG2 (cirrus clouds, chaired by Dave Starr) is considering to have a
<br>joint workshop with our group in Boulder in October. One possibility
is
<br>that they meet on Wed-Fri, October 24-26, which will give a one day
<br>overlap with our meeting (which is Mon-Wed). They are still thinking
<br>about this. I will let you know as soon as they decide. Some of us
<br>might be interested to try our microphysical schemes on test cases
WG2
<br>is using.
<p>Below is information about two upcoming workshops that some of you
<br>might be interested in. Please contact Wei-Kuo Tao
<br>(tao@agnes.gsfc.nasa.gov) for further details.
