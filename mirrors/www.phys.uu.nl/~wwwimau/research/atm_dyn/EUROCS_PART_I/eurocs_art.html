FIRE I observations for the model inter-comparison of EUROCS:
</H4>
<H2 align=center> Stratocumulus over the ocean </H2>
<P>
The primary objective of
<A HREF="http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gcss/EUROCS/EUROCS.html">EUROCS</A>
is to improve the treatment of cloud systems in global and regional
climate models. The present research focuses on the representation 
of stratocumulus over the ocean.
We will consider the full diurnal cycle of stratocumulus 
off the coast of California based on observations of the
First ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project)
Regional Experiment (FIRE).<br>
In <A HREF="http://www.phys.uu.nl/~wwwimau/EUROCS_PART_I/ERA/era_art.html">
Duynkerke and Teixeira (2001)</A> the ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA) results for 
July 1987 are compared with stratocumulus observations for the same period
made during the FIRE I experiment. They concluded that the ERA cloud thickness
is overestimated and cloud cover and liquid water path are strongly
underestimated compared with the FIRE I observations.
As a result the ERA downwelling shortwave radiation at the surface is much
larger than observed. They argued that the large difference between the ERA
downwelling shortwave radiation at the surface and that observed in FIRE I
leads to large biases in the sea-surface temperature in a coupled 
ocean-atmosphere model.<p>
We focus on the representation of diurnal variation of cloud properties
(boundary layer depth, liquid water path, optical depth, etc.), surface
energy balance and the implications for a coupled atmosphere-ocean model,
turbulence dynamics (entrainment, decoupling, etc.) in the boundary layer,
and shortwave optical properties of inhomogeneous 3-dimensional cloud fields.
The study consists of two different parts:<P>
 Part I is intended for
<A HREF="http://www.phys.uu.nl/~wwwimau/EUROCS_PART_I/eurocs.html">
Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) models and Single Column Models (SCM)</A> and
<br>
part II is for Global Circulation Models (CGM) and Regional Circulation
Models (RCM).
