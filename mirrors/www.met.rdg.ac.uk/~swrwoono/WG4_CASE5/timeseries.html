<h3>Clarification for the timeseries diagnostics.</h3>

Thanks to Tomoe Nasuno for highlighting some slightly confusing
instructions for the timeseries diagnostics. I will try and claify
this below. They have arisen from a case of "cut and paste" from
previous documens.

<UL TYPE=DISC >
<LI> Please send in the timeseries at the freqency at which you do the sampling for the profiles and the budgets. i.e. instantaneous.<BR>
  <U>except</U><BR>
    If you calculate your time averaged diagnostics by accumulating at
very high frequency in the model (e.g. a few seconds) then please use
a more reasonable frequency (every minute or so) and make it clear
that this is what you have done in a file ctdesc.modeller

<LI> Contrary to the instructions in the document. The time value
should be the time at which the data is output (not the mid-point as there is no averaging).

</UL>
