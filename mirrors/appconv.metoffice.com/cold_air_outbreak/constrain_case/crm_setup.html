  <h1>LES cold-air outbreak Case </h1>
  
  <h2> Introduction </h2>

  <p> The proposed cold-air outbreak case is a  quasi-lagrangian large 
    eddy simulation (LES), in which domain is advected 
    south-south east from 66 lat -11 lon to 60 lat -8.7 lon over the 
    warmer seas to simulate the Sc to Cu transition.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Initial conditions for the case are based on high resolution 
    limited area model (LAM) simulations performed with the 
    Met Office Unified Model (UM). These simulations have been 
    undertaken by Paul Field and are described in  
    <a href="ppt/constrain_case2.pdf"> Pan-GASS constrain presentation </a>. 
  </p>
  <br />
  <p> 
    The case is run for 14.5 hours, in which the first 1.5 hours represents a 
    spin-up using a fixed surface condition. Following "spin-up", 
    the surface is forced using prescribed time varying sea surface 
    temperature (SST). The start time and date for all simulations is 0Z on January 
    31st 2010. 
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>  
    The change in SST represents the advection of the domain 
    over warmer water. This is used as the main set-up as this 
    permits a feedback depending on the atmospheric thermodynamics. 
    (See end of page for other options)
  </p>  
  <br />
  <p> 
    The case includes interactive radiation, forcing of large scale vertical 
    velocity to simulate subsidence and geostrophic forcing of horizontal winds. 
    It is recommended that the simulation be performed with no ice microphysics 
    and where possible ice microphysics. 
  </p> 
  
  <h2> CONTROL set-up </h2> 
  
  <h3> Grid </h3>
  
  <p> The grid set-up for the CONTROL case is as follows: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> x,y domain = 96.0 x 96.0 km</li> 
    <ul><li>dx, dy = 250 m </li></ul>
    <li> z domain = 5 km </li>
    <ul><li> dz = 25 m between surface and 3000 m </li></ul>
    <ul><li> dz is then stretched between 3000 and 5000 m using the following code (based on <a href="http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/fileadmin/staff/sanduirina/zgrid.composite.f"> ASTEX setup </a> ): </li></ul>	
  </ul>
  <p class="tab1">********Example code for vertical grid stretching******</p>
  <p class="tab1"> dz_stretched = dz ! dz at 3000 m</p>
  <p class="tab1"> alpha = 1.02 </p> 
  <p class="tab1"> while z_les(k-1) lt z(Nz-1) do begin </p>
  <p class="tab2"> dz_stretched = dz_stretched * alpha </p>
  <p class="tab2"> z_les(k) = z_les (k-1) + dz_stretched </p>
  <p class="tab2"> k=k+1 </p>
  <p class="tab1">endwhile </p>
  <p class="tab1" >*******************************************************</p>
  <br />
  <p class="tab1"> As alpha = 1.02 this results in 47 extra levels above 
    3000 m, so a total of 167 levels.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p> 
    Both the horizontal resolution and vertical resolution are quite coarse,
    which is a trade off to permit the large domain.
  </p>
 
  <h3> Initial conditions </h3>
  <p> 
    The initial conditions for the case are the mean profiles for 
    66 lat -11 lon derived from high resolution UM LAM simulation 
    "u_66_11" (see Field et al, 2012, for description of LAM simulation). 
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Initial thermodynamic profiles are the adjusted liquid water potential 
    temperature (&theta<sub>l</sub>_adj) and total water (qt_adj). &theta<sub>l</sub> is 
    derived using the potential temperature and the cloud and ice water from the 
    u_66_11 results, i.e. the beginning of a lagrangian track from that simulation. 
    qt_adj is calculated by summing the vapour (qv_adj), cloud and ice water. The 
    moisture variables are also from u_66_11 at the beginning of the lagrangian track, 
    however, qv_adj is qv that is  modified so that relative humidity is 100 % in the cloud 
    region (the cloud region from the LAM simulations were close to 100 %, 
    i.e. around 95 to 97 % RH w.r.t water). Thus, the initial profile is 
    supersaturated, so cloud forms on the first time step of the simulation.   
  </p>
  <br />
  <p> 
    The initial horizontal wind components are also based mean wind fields 
    derived from u_66_11 at the beginning of the lagrangian track. The wind fields
    are characterised by a strong N-S component (12 to 17 m s<sup>-1</sup> in 
    the boundary layer) and a substantially weaker E-W component (3 to 4 
    m s<sup>-1</sup>).
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>   
    The thermodynamic and wind profile data (text format) can be downloaded from:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="text_files/initial_profiles_thl.txt"> Initial profiles </a> </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The initial thermodynamic and wind profile data is also available in 
    netcdf format in the following file:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="netcdf_setup/constrain_setup_forcing.nc"> 
	netcdf setup file </a> </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In constrain_setup_forcing.nc initial profiles are the first timestep of 
    U, V, qt and theta_l. Also, note that these profiles contain 70 levels (up to 
    200 mbar). The first 37 levels represent the recommended vertical domain for 
    this case. Finally, note that U, V, qt and theta_l contain 14.5 hours of 
    direct data from the LAM simulation and so does not include
    constant conditions for the first 1.5 hours as in with the forcing (see 
    later). Thus, this data is just provided to give a basic idea of the 
    results from the LAM simulation. 
  </p>
  <br />
  <p> The simulations are also all initialised with the following standard 
    settings:  
    <ul> 
      <li> Roughness length for momentum (Z<sub>0</sub>) = 6.6E-4 </li>
      <li> Roughness length for scalars (Z<sub>&#952</sub>) = 3.7E-6 </li>
      <li> Surface pressure = 1009 mbar </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
 
  <h3> Forcing </h3>
  <p> 
    In order for the simulation to represent the advection of the air over warmer
    water, the surface is forced to simulate the warming sea surface temperature 
    (or the increasing surface fluxes). Below is the SST forcing (text format):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="text_files/sst_force.txt"> Time varying SST </a> </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The case is also forced with large scale vertical velocity forcing derived 
    from the u_66_11 LAM simulation:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="text_files/large_scale_w_force.txt"> Large scale w forcing </a> </li>
  </ul>     
  <p>
    For convenience the time varying sensible and latent surface heat fluxes (SHF 
    and LHF, respectively), time-varying sea surface temperatures (SST) and 
    vertical velocity forcing (wsubs) are also supplied in netcdf format:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="netcdf_setup/constrain_setup_forcing.nc"> 
	netcdf setup file </a> </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Note that the SHF, LHF, SST and wsubs in the netcdf file include the 
    constant conditions for the first 1.5 hours for spin-up. 
  <p>
    Finally, the N-S horizontal velocity (v) is forced using a geostrophic 
    wind with the following values:
  </p>
  <ul> 
    <li> geostrophic wind (V<sub>G</sub>) = -15 ms<sup>-1</sup> </li>
    <li> dV<sub>G</sub>/dz = -0.0024 s<sup>-1</sup> </li>
  </ul>
   
  <h3> Ozone and Radiation profiles </h3>   
  <p> Below is a file that contains the vapour and temperature field upto 37 km  
    (derived from the the UM LAM simulation). This file also contains a standard 
    McClatchy ozone profile which has been interpolated onto the LAM vertical 
    grid. Note that the profile is set-up so that the first value is 
    top-of-atmosphere. </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="text_files/rad_o3_profs.txt"> Ozone profiles </a> </li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Microphysics settings </h3>
  <p> One of the main areas for this case to understand is the role of 
    ice microphysics in the evolution of the boundary layer during the 
    cold air outbreak. In order to start to understand this we propose 
    running at least two simulations of this case: </p>
  <ul> 
    <li> 1. No-ice case - only use warm microphysics </li>
    <li> 2. Ice case - include ice microphysics </li>
  </ul>
  <p> 
    In both cases the cloud drop number concentration is set to 
    50 cm<sup>-3</sup>. 
  </p>
  <br /> 
  <p> If institutions are not able to run their LES with ice microphysics, then
    just perform the simulation with warm micropphysics. </p>
  

  <h1> Sensitivity simulations </h1>

  <h2> Resolution Testing - "Grey zone" experiments</h2>
  <p> 
    To compare LES with the LAM output and understand the "grey zone", it is 
    proposed that a series of horizontal resolution tests are undertaken with the 
    LES, in which the horizontal domain of the CONTROL case the same as above is 
    reduced. In addition to the CONTROL we ask participants to re-run the 
    CONTROL at 4 coarser resolutions, i.e. </p> 
    <ul>
      <li> dx,dy = 500 m </li>
      <li> dx,dy = 1000 m </li>
      <li> dx,dy = 2000 m </li>
      <li> dx,dy = 4000 m </li>
    </ul>
  <p> For all these extra simulations the vertical resolution kept 
    the same as that in the standard simulation. As a minimum, in all 
    these simulations microphysics should be set to warm. If participants 
    have the time, could they also perform the simulations with ice microphysics 
    switched on.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p> 
    Finally, for institutions that have the computing power, it is proposed that 
    they run extra simulations in which the horizontal resolution is increased. 
    If provided these extra simulations will investigate whether 250m
    resolution is resolving the processes and therefore resolving the "grey zone". 
    If necessary these tests can be performed on a domain (50 km by 50 km). 
  </p> 

  
  <h2> Surface forcing </h2>
  <p> In addition to the providing the prescribed SST, the prescribed surface fluxes
    are also provided. These are also derived from the high resolution LAM and 
    they may be used to remove the uncertainty in the behaviour of the surface 
    model, particularly when the horizontal resolution is reduced. If the 
    participants have the computational resources and the time it would be 
    very useful to receive results from the CONTROL with prescribed 
    surface fluxes, in addition to the above simulations. The prescribed surface 
    fluxes can either be downloaded from the link below or they are available in 
    in the netcdf file.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="text_files/srf_flux_force.txt"> Time varying surface fluxes </a> </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2> Microphysics sensitivity </h2>
  <p> In addition to this standard simulation it would be 
    interesting redo these simulations with initial 
    cloud drop number concentration is set to 30 and/or 100 cm<sup>-3</sup>. 
    At present, there are no observations of the cloud drop 
    number concentrations in the Sc stage of the case, hence it would be useful to 
    understand how sensitive the simulations are to this
