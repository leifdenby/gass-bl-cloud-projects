  <h1>Specification for GCM cold-air outbreak Case </h1>
  
  <p>
    Below we describe the setup for the global model intercomparison, and
    suggest different sensitivity experiments. We are trying to be as
    inclusive as possible and will accept contributions also in case they
    deviate in some aspects from the provided requirements.  
  </p>

  <h2> Time period </h2>  
  <p>
    Start date of the forecast: 12Z 30th January 2010. The simulation should
    be run for 36 hours (i.e. until 00Z 1st February 2010).
  </p>

  <h2> Resolutions </h2>
  <p>
    We encourage the groups to run their global models at the highest
    possible resolutions. In order to be able to investigate the
    scale-dependency of the parameterizations, the models should be run at
    at least two different resolutions. Global resolutions of 10 km and 5 km
    are recommended, but higher resolutions are welcome.
    In case the global model allows for grid refinement (one-way nesting or
    two-way nesting) or grid stretching, we encourage the groups to also
    perform 1km and 2km resolution simulations for the region of interest.
    In case you use grid refinement by one-way nesting and submit the output
    of the refined grid to the LAM intercomparison, you do not need to
    submit the same data to the global model intercomparison.
  </p>

  <h2> Forcing Data </h2>
  <p> 
    To be consistent with the LAM intercomparison it is recommended that the 
    GCM is initialised using ECMWF analysis. 
  </p>

  <h2> Parametrization switches </h2>
  <p>
    For each of the global model grid resolutions we would like to receive
    results from the two permutations of the convection off and on. There
    might be other parameterizations that should be switched on or off. For
    instance your global model might have a separate shallow and deep
    cumulus convection scheme. Please feel free to experiment with different
    combinations of these parameterisations switched on and/or off.
    In case you have different convection or boundary layer
    parameterizations implemented in your model, it is very welcome if you
    produce separate experiments with different parameterizations. Could
    participants please provide details regarding the used
    parameterisations, and references.
  </p>
