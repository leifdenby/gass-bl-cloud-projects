face=Arial>Each participating group has been invited to make presentations for 
an in-depth analysis of its CGILS results. The presentations will cover all 
three CGILS locations (shallow cumulus, stratocumulus and stratus, at locations 
s6, s11, s12) , although emphasis will be for location s11 where LES results are 
available. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial>The meeting is open to public, but 
only presentations related to the meeting objectives are invited. If you do not 
belong to a participating group and wish to make a presentation, please send an
