study
<BR><PRE><BIG>Dear EUCLIPSE friends and other interested modelers,

As discussed during the EUCLIPSE kick-off meeting in September 2010 in 
Utrecht we promised to set up an intercomparison case for the radiation 
codes used in the various climate models that participate in EUCLIPSE 
WP1. The main objective is to quantify the intermodel spread in ToA 
albedo for typical marine stratocumulus. Also radiation codes that are 
used in LES models or as stand alone tools are more than welcome to 
participate.

The case is based on observations of stratocumulus off the coast of 
Africa over the Southern Atlantic Ocean. The runs are not costly, since 
only a one-time step of the LES code and/or SCM version of a GCM is 
required and a limited set of output data is asked. We propose a range 
of cases with different Liquid Water Path (LWP), different options for 
the microphysics, and different vertical resolutions. For further 
detailed instructions, motivation and required output we refer to the 
<A href="http://www.euclipse.nl/wp3/Radiation_Intercomparison/Introduction.shtml">radiation intercomparison webpage</A>.

Please let us know asap whether you will participate!

We require to receive the results before 31 March 2011 so that there will 
be enough time to analyse the results before the CFMIP/GCSS/EUCLIPSE 
meeting in June in Exeter.
