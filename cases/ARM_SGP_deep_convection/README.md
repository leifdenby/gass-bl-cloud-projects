#  Continental deep convection

Details of setup in Cerderwall et all 2000

> A continental case based on intensive measurements taken at the ARM
(Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program) Southern Great Plains experimental
site during June and July 1997

> It corresponds to summer convection over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) of
Oklahoma, an area characterized by an early evening maximum of cumulonimbus
clouds in summer (Lazarus et al. 2000)

Three "case periods" were studied in CRMs (Cloud Resolving Models)

```
A: 2330 UTC 26 June 1997 - 2330 UTC 30 June 1997    4 days    precip
B: 2330 UTC  7 July 1997 - 2330 UTC 12 July 1997    5 days    precip
C: 2330 UTC 12 July 1997 - 2330 UTC 17 July 1997    5 days    precip
```

## Characteristics

- over land

- intercomparison based on one month (18 June to 17 July 1997) of observations
which "contained a wide range of summertime weather conditions"
