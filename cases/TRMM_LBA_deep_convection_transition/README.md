# Daytime convective development over land: an idealized case based on TRMM-LBA observations

*From GEWEX Cloud System Study - Working Group 4 Model Intercomparison
Projects, Case 4*

> The purpose of this case is to investigate the development of the daytime
convective boundary layer over land and the transition from shallow to deep
convection. Large-scale and climate models usually struggle to represent the
observed diurnal cycle of convection over land, with deep convection typically
developing too early when compared to observations. The actual sounding and the
evolution of surface fluxes as the day progresses come from observations on
February 23, 1999, during the TRMM-LBA field campaign in Rondonia, Brazil.
