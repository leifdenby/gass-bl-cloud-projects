# BOMEX non-precipitating shallow cumulus

Field experiment published in Holland and Rasmusson (1973) and Nitta and
Esbensen (1974).

LES setup published in Siebesma, A. P., and coauthors, 2003: A large-eddy
simulation intercomparison study of shallow cumulus convection. J. Atmos. Sci.,
60, 1201-1219

Characteristics (*needs verifying*):

- no precipitation (precipitation was turned of in microphysics of original
intercomparison)

- no cloud-deck formed at inversion height (which was observed in ATEX case)
