# Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program - Southern Great Plains site (ARM SGP)

*still WIP, github issue:

> Brown et al 2002: ... based on an idealization of observations made at the
Southern Great Plains (SGP) site of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM)
Program on 21 June 1997. The site consists of in situ and remote-sensing
instrumented clusters arrayed across approximately 140 000 km2 in Oklahoma and
Kansas. On the day in question, cumulus clouds developed at the top of an
initially clear convective boundary layer.

Field experiment documented in Stokes and Schwartz (1994), Ackerman and Stokes
(2003)

LES described in Brown et al. (2002)

## Characteristics

- strong diurnal cycle first forced (not reaching LFC) and later free shallow
convection, maximum surface fluxes "far in excess" of BOMEX and ATEX cases
(which were over ocean).

- surface fluxes dominate, large-scale forcings are weak in comparison

- significant change in Bowen ratio ($\approx 0.3$) from BOMEX ($\approx
0.06$), more transport through sensible heat compared to latent heat.
