# Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program - Southern Great Plains site (ARM SGP)

Field experiment documented in Stokes and Schwartz (1994), Ackerman and Stokes
(2003)

LES described in Brown et al. (2002)

## Characteristics

- strong diurnal cycle first forced (not reaching LFC) and later free shallow
convection, maximum surface fluxes "far in excess" of BOMEX and ATEX cases
(which were over ocean).

- surface fluxes dominate, large-scale forcings are weak in comparison

- significant change in Bowen ratio ($\approx 0.3$) from BOMEX ($\approx
0.06$), more transport through sensible heat compared to latent heat.
